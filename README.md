# Boost PyPI

This repo contains automation for [Boost](https://github.com/boostorg/boost).

It creates, packages and pushes the header-only library `libboost-headers` to PyPI.
This repo is the equivalent of the [Anaconda libboost-headers](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/libboost-headers) package.

**NOTE:** Packages created by this repo only contain the raw source code and not a Python package.

Credits go to the maintainers of the [Boost](https://github.com/boostorg/boost) package.
